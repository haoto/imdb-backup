IMDb Message Board Backup
=========================

Usage
-----
Pre-packaged version is available on the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imdb-message-board-backup/dlmmknfhboinpfmdiennbilgeibodabk

To back up your IMDb message board posts, navigate to your IMDb profile page, then click the extension icon and wait.

DO NOT interact with Chrome until downloading completes. (I'm sure this is easy to fix but I'm shit at Javascript and this is my first Chrome extension. Sorry.)
